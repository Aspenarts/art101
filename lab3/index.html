		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
		<p>This lab was to show us how to create a local file, how to add it to the index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges </h2>
		<p>I had challenges in getting my image to load in, but after referencing another lab - I was able to make the website functional. I had some issues with the code, but was able to work out the rest of the issues with my partner Adrian.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is the file structure we created</p>
